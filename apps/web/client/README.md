# EchoPages Frontend

A simple frontend demo for the EchoPages immersive reading platform.

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Upload PDF files for reading
- **Text Input**: Paste text directly into the reader
- **E-Reader Interface**: Clean reading experience with emotion-matched music concept
- **Mock Data**: Uses sample data to demonstrate the UI (no backend required)

## Running the App

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

The app will run on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## Project Structure

- `src/pages/` - Main pages (Home, Upload, Reader)
- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/data/` - Mock data for demonstration
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions

## Note

This is a frontend-only demo. The upload functionality and reader display mock data and don't connect to a real backend.
